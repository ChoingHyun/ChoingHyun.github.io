笔者为iOS新手，接触iOS不久，在这里开始写博文，记录学习过程中的点滴

**2015.10.1**

Starting learining by reading the book *The Big Nerd Ranch Guide 4th Edition*

### The Words
There's some concept what I can't recognize before in the book,I find the mesns from search engine.The concept list:

#### big ideas

#### going through the motions
走过场 

Example：We have learned that “going through the motions” is much more important than it sounds. 
	
#### typos

Example：But the best way to learn coding is to find and fix your typos. 
	
#### Peloponnesian War
* 伯罗奔尼撒战争是以雅典为首的提洛同盟与以斯巴达为首的伯罗奔尼撒联盟之间的一场战争。这场战争从前431年一直持续到前404年，期间双方曾几度停战，最终斯巴达获得胜利。
* 这场战争结束了雅典的经典时代，也结束了希腊的民主时代，强烈地改变了希腊的国家。战争给繁荣的古希腊带来了前所未有的破坏，导致战后希腊奴隶制城邦的危机，整个希腊开始由盛转衰。
* 几乎所有希腊的城邦参加了这场战争，其战场几乎涉及了整个当时希腊语世界。在现代研究中也有人称这场战争为“古代世界大战”。

#### get one's feet wet
　　[释] to start learning something;

　　[例] After graduation, it was the time for Mike to get his feet wet in the real world.
　　
#### minicry
Mimicry is a powerful form of learning.

#### boilerplate
Too much boilerplate gets in the way of learning how things work.

#### break down
划分

### Learning Tip

#### Concentrate on the e-book:
Set yourself a reasonable goal, like “I will do one chapter every day.” When you sit down to attack a chapter, find a quiet place where you will not be interrupted for at least an hour. Shut down your email, your Twitter client, and your chat program. This is not a time for multi-tasking; you will need to concentrate.
####Here are two things you can do to make the journey easier:• **Find someone who already knows how to write iOS applications and will answer your questions.** In particular, getting your application onto the device the first time is usually very frustrating if you are doing it without the help of an experienced developer.• **Get enough sleep. Sleepy people do not remember what they have learned.**
